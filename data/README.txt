This folder contains all files relating to the GEO dataset.
functional_parser.py is the parser used to extract the files 'genes.txt', 'probes.txt', and 'expression.txt' with respective columns in tab-delimited form.
parser_test-files are working versions of the fully functional parser and were kept for educational reasons.
'isolates.txt.' and 'strains.txt' are manually generated files containing data from the full GEO dataset.
GDS4479_full.soft is the full GEO dataset. It was decided to keep this dataset in the git repository since it is fairly small and for ease of access.
The other files are files used for testing and for bugfixing the parser and were kept for educational reasons.
